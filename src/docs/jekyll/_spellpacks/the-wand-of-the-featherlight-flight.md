This [spell pack](/spellpacks.html) is a Wizards of Lua add-on that adds a magic wand to the Minecraft game.

The magic wand is a special feather that can lift you into the air. Just look into the sky and swing it. Best used together with an elytra.

See the [project homepage](https://github.com/wizards-of-lua/featherlight) for more information.
