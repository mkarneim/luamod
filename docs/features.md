*The Wizards of Lua modification adds the /lua command to Minecraft, which
gives you the power to cast a magical spell in Minecraft, which actually is
a little Lua program.*

With a spell you can, for example, do the following:

* Create magical items.
* Create mini games.
* Create procedural structures.

To do all this, you just need to learn how to cast spells.

Actually you need to become a Wizard of Lua.
That means getting familiar with [Lua](http://www.lua.org), the language of magic,
and studying magic words documented in the secretive [spell book library](/spellbooklibrary).

As a wizard, you will know how to execute the following great magical powers:

* [Access and change any block](/modules/Blocks) in the Minecraft world, including data values and NBT values.
* [Query](/modules/Entities) and manipulate [players](/modules/Player), [creatures](/modules/Entity), and [items](/modules/Items).
* [Receive](/modules/Events/#connect) in-game events like [left-click-block](/modules/LeftClickBlockEvent), [swing-arm](/modules/SwingArmEvent), and many others.
* [Fire](/modules/Events/#fire) and handle [custom events](/modules/CustomEvent).
* [Execute](/modules/Spell/#execute) any vanilla Minecraft command and commands from other mods.
* [Access](/tutorials/importing_lua_files/) self-made Lua modules from the server's file system.
* Run multiple spells simultaneously.
* Use all Lua language features, e.g. variables, loops, conditional bocks, and functions.

If you want to start right now, please read the [introduction](/introduction).
