The new 1.2.1-alpha release contains bugfixes.
<!--more-->

* Fixed [#50](https://github.com/wizards-of-lua/wizards-of-lua/issues/50) - Placing a door using spell.block is not working
* Fixed [#51](https://github.com/wizards-of-lua/wizards-of-lua/issues/51) - luaTicksLimit is not stored correctly into config file when changed with /wol command
* Fixed [#52](https://github.com/wizards-of-lua/wizards-of-lua/issues/52) - Add automatic version checking

Especially fix [#50](https://github.com/wizards-of-lua/wizards-of-lua/issues/50) is important since
it improves the performance when a lot of blocks are changed in a short period of time.
