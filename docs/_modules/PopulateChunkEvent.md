The <span class="notranslate">PopulateChunkEvent</span> is the base class of the
 [PostPopulateChunkEvent](/modules/PostPopulateChunkEvent).

 Please note that instances of these events could occur asynchronously to the game loop. Hence, if
 you use an event interceptor to handle them, make sure that your code is thread safe.
