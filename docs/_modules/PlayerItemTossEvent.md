The <span class="notranslate">PlayerItemTossEvent</span> is fired whenever a player tosses (for
example by pressing 'Q') an item or drag-n-drops a stack of items outside the inventory GUI
screens.

Canceling the event will stop the items from entering the world, but will not prevent them being
removed from the inventory - and thus removed from the system.
