properties:
  - name: uuid
    type: string
    access: r
    description: "The 'uuid' is a string of 36 characters forming an immutable universally
    unique identifier that identifies this virtual entity inside the world.
    This means if entities have the same ID they are actually the same object.
    "
  - name: world
    type: "[World](/modules/World/)"
    access: r

      The world the the space this entity is living in.

    "
  - name: dimension
    type: number
    access: r
    description: "The 'dimension' is a magic number that tells us something about
    the world where this entity currently is living in. 0 means the Overworld.
    -1 is the Nether, and 1 is the End.
    "
  - name: pos
    type: "[Vec3](/modules/Vec3/)"
    access: r/w
    description: "The 'pos' is short for 'position'. It is a 3-dimensional vector
    containing the location of this virtual entity inside the world it is living in.
    "
  - name: facing
    type: string
    access: r
    description: "The 'facing' is the compass direction this virtual entity is facing.
    This is one of 'north', 'east', 'south', and 'west'.
    "
  - name: lookVec
    type: "[Vec3](/modules/Vec3/)"
    access: r/w
    description: |
      The 'lookVec' is a 3-dimensional vector that points into the direction this virtual entity is looking at.

      #### Example
      Moving the spell into the owners eye and pointing it into the owner's look direction.
      ```lua
      spell.pos = spell.owner.pos+Vec3(0,spell.owner.eyeHeight,0);
      spell.lookVec = spell.owner.lookVec
      ```    
  - name: rotationYaw
    type: number
    access: r/w
    description: "The 'rotationYaw' is the rotation of this entity around its Y axis in degrees.
    For example, a value of 0 means the entity is facing south. 90 corresponds to west, and 45 to south-west.
    "
  - name: rotationPitch
    type: number
    access: r/w
    description: "The 'rotationPitch' is the rotation of this entity's head around its X axis in degrees. A value of -90 means the entity is looking straight up. A value of 90 means it is looking straight down.
    "
  - name: motion
    type: "[Vec3](/modules/Vec3/)"
    access: r/w
    description: "The 'motion' is a 3-dimensional vector that represents the velocity of this entity when it is moved by some
    external force, e.g. when it is falling or when it is pushed by an explosion.
    "
  - name: tags
    type: table
    access: r/w
    description: "The 'tags' value is a list of strings that have been assigned to this entity.
    "
  - name: alive
    type: boolean
    access: r
    description: "This is true, if this entity is alive, false otherwise.

functions:
  - name: move
    parameters: direction, distance
    results: nil
    description: |
      The 'move' function teleports this entity instantly to the position
      relative to its current position specified by the given direction and distance.
      If no distance is specified, 1 meter is taken as default distance.
      Valid direction values are absolute directions ('up', 'down', 'north', 'east',
      'south', and 'west'), as well as relative directions ('forward', 'back',
      'left', and 'right'). Relative directions are interpreted relative to the direction the entity is
      [facing](/modules/VirtualEntity/#facing).

      #### Example
      Moving the spell 1 meter upwards.
      ```lua
      spell.move( "up")
      ```

      #### Example
      Moving the spell 10 meters to the north.
      ```lua
      spell.move( "north", 10)
      ```

      #### Example
      Building a huge circle of wool blocks.
      ```lua
      wool=Blocks.get( "wool")
      for i=1,360 do
        spell.block=wool
        spell.rotationYaw=spell.rotationYaw+1
        spell:move("forward")
      end
      ```    
  - name: addTag
    parameters: string
    results: boolean
    description: "The 'addTag' function adds the given tag to the set of [tags](/modules/VirtualEntity/#tags) of this entity.
    This function returns true if the tag was added successfully.
    "
  - name: removeTag
    parameters: string
    results: boolean
    description: "The 'removeTag' function removes the given tag from the set of [tags](/modules/VirtualEntity/#tags) of this entity.
    This function returns true if the tag has been removed successfully, and false if there was no such tag.
    "
  - name: scanView
    parameters: distance
    results: "[BlockHit](/modules/BlockHit/)"
    description: "The 'scanView' function scans the view of this entity for the next
    (non-liquid) block. On success it returns a [BlockHit](/modules/BlockHit/), otherwise nil.
    It scans the view with a line-of-sight-range of up to the given distance (meter).
    "
