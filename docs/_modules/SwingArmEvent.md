The <span class="notranslate">SwingArmEvent</span> is fired whenever a [Player](/modules/Player) waves an arm.
This can be the left arm or the right arm. This event is fired on three occasions:
- just before the [RightClickBlockEvent](/modules/RightClickBlockEvent)
- just before the [LeftClickBlockEvent](/modules/LeftClickBlockEvent)
- when the player does a left-click into the air.
