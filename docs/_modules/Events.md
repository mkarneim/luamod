    description: "The 'connect' function creates and returns an [EventQueue](/modules/EventQueue/)
    that is connected to the event source.
    It will collect all occuring [events](/modules/Event/) of the given kind(s).

    description: "The 'fire' function posts a new [CustomEvent](/modules/CustomEvent/)
    with the given name and the optional given content data.
    "
    examples:
      - url: Events/fire.md
  - name: "on"
    parameters: eventNames...
    results: table
    description: |
        Returns a table containing the specified event names and a reference to [subscribe](#subscribe).
        This can be used as a short cut for [subscribe](#subscribe).
        #### Example
        Subscribing for chat events.
        ```lua
        local subscription = Events.on('ChatEvent'):call(
          function(event)
            print(str(event))
          end
        )
        ```
  - name: subscribe
    parameters: eventNames, eventListener
    results: "[EventSubscription](/modules/EventSubscription)"
    description: |
        Subscribes the specified event listener to events with the specified names.
        It will be called immediately when an event occurs, this allows events to be canceled.
        Events listeners do not support sleeping; therefor, [autosleep](/modules/Time#autosleep) is disabled and sleeping manually is treated as an illegal operation.
        As long as a spell has active event subscriptions it doesn't terminate so make sure to unsubscribe any event listeners that are no longer needed.
        In order to cancel the subscription an [EventSubscription](/modules/EventSubscription) is returned.

        #### Example
        Subscribing for chat events.
        ```lua
        local subscription = Events.subscribe({'ChatEvent'},
          function(event)
            print(str(event))
          end
        )
        ```

        **Note**: Be careful when modifying variables that are used in the main program.
        If [autosleep](/modules/Time#autosleep) is enabled the main program can fall asleep at any time and a variable might be modified in an awkward position.
        For instance the following program fails due to indexing a nil value in line 8 despite the nil check in line 6.
        In this example there is an explicit sleep in line 7, but that sleep could just as well be caused by [autosleep](/modules/Time#autosleep).
        ```lua
        local abc = 'abc'
        local sub = Events.subscribe({'my-event'},
          function(event)
            abc = nil
          end
        )
        spell:execute("lua Events.fire('my-event')")
        if abc ~= nil then
          sleep(1)
          print(abc:len())
          end
        sub:unsubscribe()
        ```
