'Vec3' is short for '3-dimensional Vector'.
Mostly a 3-dimensional vector is used to denote a position in the
3-dimensional world space. And sometimes it is used to denote a constant velocity
of an object inside that space.
Actually a vector can be used for many other 'things' that can be described by
3 independent numerical values.

To create a vector you can call the Vec3 function:
```lua
/lua myvec = Vec3( 1, 2, 3)
```
This creates a vector called 'myvec' with the component values x=1, y=2, z=3.
