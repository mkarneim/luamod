<a name="Personal-Files" style="position:relative; top:-70px; display:block;"></a>
## Personal Files
In order to store your spells for later use, you can create a file and save it into
your personal directory.
Then you can load your spells any time after by calling ```require```.

*Example:*

To load the contents of the file ```myfile.lua``` into the current spell and
call the function ```myFunc()``` which is declared in that file, just execute the following
command:

```lua
/lua require("myfile"); myFunc()
```

Per default, a personal file is only visible to the owner.
In order to access it from outside, e.g. from within a command block, you have to call ```addpath```.

*Example:*

```lua
/lua addpath("mickkay"); require("myfile"); myFunc()
```
This spell adds mickkay's personal directory to the spell's Lua search path.
After that, the spell can load any of mickkay's files.

<a name="Lua-Ticks-Limit" style="position:relative; top:-70px; display:block;"></a>
## Lua Ticks Limit Configuration
The <tt>luaTicksLimit</tt> value defines how many Lua ticks each spell can use during
a single game tick. When this value is exceeded, the spell will be broken or
sent to sleep for one game tick. This depends on the [Time.autosleep](/modules/Time/#autosleep) setting.

### Showing the Lua Ticks Limit
```
/wol luaTicksLimit
```
This will print the current value into your chat screen.

### Setting the Lua Ticks Limit
```
/wol luaTicksLimit set 100000
```
This will set the number of Lua tick a spell can use during a single game tick to 100000.
Allowed are values between 1000 and 10000000.
Default is 10000.

The new value will also stored into the config file at <tt>config/wizards-of-lua/wizards-of-lua.luacfg</tt>, which means that it survives a server restart.

Please use this with care, since this can slow down your Minecraft server, especially
when there are a lot of spells runnung concurrently.
