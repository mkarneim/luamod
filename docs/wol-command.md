## Lua Ticks Limit Configuration
The <tt>luaTicksLimit</tt> value defines how many Lua ticks each spell can use during
a single game tick. When this value is exceeded, the spell will be broken or
sent to sleep for one game tick. This depends on the [Runtime.autosleep](/modules/Runtime/#setAutoSleep) setting.

### Showing the Lua Ticks Limit
```
/wol luaTicksLimit
```
This will print the current value into your chat screen.

### Setting the Lua Ticks Limit
```
/wol luaTicksLimit set 100000
```
This will set the number of Lua tick a spell can use during a single game tick to 100000.
Allowed are values between 1000 and 10000000.
Default is 10000.

The new value will also stored into the config file at <tt>config/wizards-of-lua/wizards-of-lua.cfg</tt>, which means that it survives a server restart.

Please use this with care, since this can slow down your Minecraft server, especially
when there are a lot of spells runnung concurrently.
