title: The Wol Command

The <tt>/wol</tt> command (wol is short for Wizards Of Lua) gives you some
control over the Winzards of Lua mod.

As with version 1.0.0-alpha this command is still very limited.
Here are all available actions:

### Listing all active spells
To get a list of all active spells just type:
```
/wol spell list all
```

### Breaking all active spells
To break all active spells just type:
```
/wol spell break all
```
