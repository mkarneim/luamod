control over the Winzards of Lua mod.*

<br/>

## Listing Spells
### Listing all Active Spells

```
/wol spell list all
```
This will print the list of all active spells.
For each spell you will get the spell ID (SID), followed by the first 40 characters of its code.

There are several options to break spells.

### Breaking all Active Spells

```
/wol spell break all

This will break all active spells immediately.

### Breaking Spells by Name

Please note that you can [change the name](/modules/Spell/#name) of any spell.

<a name="Automatic-Requirements" style="position:relative; top:-70px; display:block;"></a>
## Automatic Requirements
The <tt>autoRequire</tt> value is a player-specific value that defines which Lua module will be loaded
automatically into a new spell's environment.
The respective module must be available within the [player's Lua path](/configuration-file.html).

### Showing the autoRequire value
```
/wol autoRequire
```
This prints the value of the "autoRequire" setting.

### Setting the autoRequire value
Lets assume that the current player has a file called "myprofile.lua" in his
Lua library directory.
```
/wol autoRequire set myprofile
```
This sets the "myprofile" module as the automatic requirement for the current player.
This is equivalent to prefixing a new spell's code with <tt>require "myprofile"</tt>.

### Unsetting the autoRequire value
```
/wol autoRequire unset
```
This sets the value of the "autoRequire" setting to none.

<a name="Lua-Ticks-Limit" style="position:relative; top:-70px; display:block;"></a>
## Lua Ticks Limit Configuration
The <tt>luaTicksLimit</tt> value defines how many Lua ticks each spell can use during
a single game tick. When this value is exceeded, the spell will be broken or
sent to sleep for one game tick. This depends on the [Time.autosleep](/modules/Time/#autosleep) setting.

### Showing the Lua Ticks Limit
```
/wol luaTicksLimit
```
This will print the current value into your chat screen.

### Setting the Lua Ticks Limit
```
/wol luaTicksLimit set 100000
```
This will set the number of Lua tick a spell can use during a single game tick to 100000.
Allowed are values between 1000 and 10000000.
Default is 10000.

The new value will also stored into the config file at <tt>config/wizards-of-lua/wizards-of-lua.luacfg</tt>, which means that it survives a server restart.

Please use this with care, since this can slow down your Minecraft server, especially
when there are a lot of spells runnung concurrently.
