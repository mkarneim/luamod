<br/>
To make a door like this, place two command blocks in a distance of
4 blocks from each other.
The left one is for opening the door, the right one for closing it.
Place two buttons above each command block, one from the inside the
cave, one from outside.

Here is a picture of it.

b=Blocks.get("air");
for y=0,3 do
  for z=1,4 do
    spell.pos=s+Vec3(0,y,-z);
    if spell.block.name~="air" then
      spell.block=b;
      spell:execute("particle blockcrack ~ ~ ~ 0.2 0.2 0.2 0 20");
