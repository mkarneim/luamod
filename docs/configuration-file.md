title: The Wizards of Lua Configuration File
---
*The Wizards of Lua Mod stores its configuration in a configuration file.
This file can be edited prior to server startup.*

The Wizards of Lua configuration is located at <tt>&lt;minecraft&gt;/conf/wizards-of-lua/wizards-of-lua.luacfg</tt>,
where &lt;minecraft&gt; is your Minecraft folder.

Please not that the configuration file is loaded into Minecraft only once at startup.
It gets frequently overwritten when the mod's configuration has been changed by some [/wol command](/wol-command.html).
You should only edit it manually when Minecraft is not running, otherwise your changes will be ignored and might get overwritten.

## Example
Here is an example of the <tt>wizards-of-lua.luacfg</tt>:
```lua
General {
  luaTicksLimit=10000,
  showAboutMessage=true,
  luaLibDirHome="libs" }
Wizard {
  id="0c77f1a8-943b-4f7b-aa09-f2b1737d4f03",
  libDir="0c77f1a8-943b-4f7b-aa09-f2b1737d4f03",
  autoRequire="myprofile" }
Wizard {
  id="d26feccb-baae-4d90-8e3d-50389e8b8ad9",
  libDir="d26feccb-baae-4d90-8e3d-50389e8b8ad9",
  autoRequire="" }
```

## Format
The contents of <tt>wizards-of-lua.luacfg</tt> is actually valid Lua code which is executed by Wol at server startup.
"General" and "Wizard" are two internal functions that accept a Lua table as parameter.

### General
This function sets the mod's general configuration.
* **luaTicksLimit**: defines the number of Lua ticks a spell can run continuously before it must sleep at least for one game tick.
This value can be modified from within the game by [/wol luaTicksLimit](/wol-command.html#Lua-Ticks-Limit).
* **showAboutMessage**: defines, whether the mod's about message is shown to new users when they log into the server.
Please note, that until the next server restart the about message is only shown once to each user.
* **luaLibDirHome**: defines the relative or absolute location of the home of all Lua library directories.
This directory is parent to the shared libs and all user-specific library directories.

### Wizard
This function adds a player-specific configuration.
New entries are added automatically when a new player uses the [/lua command](/lua-command.html) or the [/wol command](/wol-command.html) the first time.
* **id**: is the UUID of the player this configuration belongs to.
* **libDir**: defines the relative or absolute location of the player-specific Lua library directory.
If defined as relative, it will be located inside the directory defined by <tt>General.luaLibDirHome</tt>.
* **autoRequire**: defines the optional name of the module that should be required automatically when a new spell is casted by this player. Default is empty.
This value can be modified from within the game by [/wol autoRequire](/wol-command.html#Automatic-Requirements).
