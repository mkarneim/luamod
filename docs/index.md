The Wizards of Lua are a community of programmers and their friends
who want to promote interactive programming into a new level
of game experience.

The Wizards of Lua is also a Minecraft modification that simply adds
the ```/lua``` command to the game.
Right  this command you can enter sequence of statements that form
a valid Lua program.

For example, you could enter the following line into the chat:
```lua
/lua for i=1,10 do place("stone"); move(UP); end
```
This will create a pillar of stone directly in front of you, 10 meters tall.
