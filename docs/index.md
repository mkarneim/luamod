title: Welcome to the Home of the Wizards of Lua
---
The Wizards of Lua are a [community of programmers and their friends](/members.html),
who want to spread the knowledge of programming to kids.
The Wizards of Lua are also some decent gamers
who want to give gamers and artists the ability to create their own game contents.

And of course, "Wizards of Lua" is the name of a Minecraft
modification that simply adds the [/lua&nbsp;command](/lua-command.html) to the game.

By [installing](/installation.html) the 'Wizards of Lua' mod
onto your Minecraft server, you are changing the nature of your Minecraft
game: it becomes magical in a wordly sense.
This mod transforms [Lua, the programming language](https://www.lua.org),
into a 'lingua magica', a language of magic, that wizards can use to create
and cast powerful spells to control almost any aspect of the world.
