title: Using the str() Function

This tutorial shows how you could use the <tt>str()</tt> function to get
a glance of the internal structure of an object.
This is obviously especially useful when you don't know how this object is structured.

For example, let's pretend you are looking at the trunk of a birch tree.

![Looking at a Birch](/images/looking-at-a-birch.png)

When you execute a spell like this:
```lua
/lua print( spell.block))
```
you just get something like the following not very meaningful output:
```lua
table: 0x0626bef0
```
What you see is the standard output format for a Lua table.
This is because the underlying representation of a [Block](/modules/Block/) in Lua is a Lua table.

So this is not helpful.
But we can do better.
By using the <tt>str()</tt> function you can get a string with the table's contents
in a human readable way.
```lua
/lua print( str( spell.block)))
```
Now you get this:
```lua
{
  data = {
    axis = "y",
    variant = "birch"
  },
  material = {
    blocksLight = true,
    blocksMovement = true,
    canBurn = true,
    liquid = false,
    mobility = "NORMAL",
    opaque = true,
    replaceable = false,
    requiresNoTool = true,
    solid = true
  },
  name = "log"
}
```
Now you can see the internal structure of the table.
As you can see, a table is just list of properties.
The properties are enclosed in curly braces and seperated by commas.
For each property you see a key-value pair.
For example, at the very bottom there is the "name" property.
Its key is "name" and its value is "log".
As you can see, the value is enclosed in quotation marks, while for the key the quotation marks are omitted.

You can also see that the properties have a tree-like structure.
For example, the "data" property has a value that itself is a table.


Now that you know the internal structure of the Block, you can rewrite the spell
so that it only prints the part you are interested in, e.g. its name.
```lua
/lua print( spell.block.name)
```
Which gives this:
```lua
log
```
