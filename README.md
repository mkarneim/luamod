# "Wizards of Lua" Mod

The Wizards of Lua Mod is a modification of Minecraft that adds the `/lua` command to the game.

Since this is an early access version of the mod there is no public download link for the binary available.
We are still working hard to get some stable version.
However, if you are interested you can of course build it yourself from the sources.

More information about this mod is available at the [Wizards of Lua homepage](http://www.wizards-of-lua.net).
